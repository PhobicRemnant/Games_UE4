# UE4 Projects and Tools

This repo is dedicated to storing any useful UE4 code to keep in inventory for game development. The idea is to be able to generate multiple solutions for gameloops.

Currently this has:

- 3rd Person Shooter character and mechanics:
  - Raytracing weapon collision.
  - Actual projectile trace and collision.

- Weapon and ammunition. (Weapon types yet to me implemented)

- Door opening.
